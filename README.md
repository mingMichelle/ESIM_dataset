Event camera dataset
This line inlcudes both dataset for Event-based High Dynamic Range Image and Very High Frame Rate Video Generation using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks and EventSR: From Asynchronous Events to Image Reconstruction, Restoration, and Super-Resolution via End-to-End Adversarial Learning. 
Since the dataset is hugh in size, we could not provide them here, instead we put them in Baidu drive which is convenient to download.
